#### üí¨ Have you ever wondered about the differences between `interface` and `type` aliases in TypeScript? What actually TypeScript is? How does it help us improve code quality and make us powerful when it comes to scaling our projects or working in a team?

In this document, let's explore these together. I will share my findings and insights, and please let me know if you have any concerns or thoughts. I would love to hear from you.

# Differences between interface and type aliases in TypeScript

As part of my TypeScript learning journey, I have come across that there are two ways to define the types in TypeScript: using `interface` and `type` aliases. While they seem similar, in many cases, they seem to behave the same. But there are some key differences between them. While exploring typescript with the help of its core documentation and community resources, I found some interesting insights. In this document, I will summarize the differences and provide examples to illustrate them.

## 1. Interface and Type both can be used to define object shapes

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type PersonType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

You see? No difference here! They both work the same way. Both `interface` and `type` can be used to define the shape of an object. In the example above, both `Person` and `PersonType` define an object with `name` and `age` properties.

## 2. Interface can be extended, and in a way, types can be extended too

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

type PersonType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type EmployeeType = PersonType & {
  employeeId: number;
};
```

In the example above, we see that `Employee` extends `Person`, and `EmployeeType` extends `PersonType`. This is a key difference between `interface` and `type`. While both can be extended, `interface` uses the `extends` keyword, while `type` uses the intersection operator (`&`) to combine types. This is the most common way to extend types in TypeScript using `type` aliases and `interface`.

## 3. Interface can be redefined, but type cannot

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

type PersonType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type PersonType = {
  employeeId: number;
};
```

In the example above, we see that `Person` can be redefined to add new properties. This is not possible with `type` aliases. If we try to redefine a `type`, we will get an error. An error something like: duplicate identifier 'PersonType'. This is a key difference between `interface` and `type`. We can think of `interface` as a more flexible way to define types, while `type` is more rigid.

## 4. Types can only be used to define the shape for primitive types, Tuples, and Unions

```typescript
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

type Point = [number, number];

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = Person & {
  employeeId: number;
};
```

In the example above, we see that `type` can be used to define primitive types, tuples, and unions. This is not possible with `interface`. We cannot use `interface` to define a union type or a tuple type. This is a key difference between `interface` and `type`. We can think of `type` as a more powerful way to define types, while `interface` is more limited in its capabilities.

## 5. According to the TypeScript documentation, `interface` is more performant rather than `type` while declaring objects

    ‚ÄúWe recommend using an interface over a type alias when possible.‚Äù
    ‚Äì TypeScript Handbook

The TypeScript team has stated that `interface` is the preferred way to define object shapes in TypeScript, and it is recommended to use `interface` whenever possible. This is because `interface` is a more optimized way to define types when it comes to performance in TypeScript. But why? TypeScript was built with interface as the primary way to describe the shape of an object. It‚Äôs part of the original design. While type came later to support more advanced and flexible type compositions (like unions and intersections), interface was always meant for describing structured, named shapes ‚Äî especially those that can be extended or implemented in classes. And also Interface works better with classes because it aligns with the implements keyword.

On the other hand, Because interfaces are open, and TypeScript tracks them structurally. They‚Äôre easier to evaluate and check for compatibility when reused. `type`, especially, when used with complex intersections, unions, and conditional types, can quickly become harder to analyze, making the type-checking process slower. This difference is small in regular projects ‚Äî but in massive enterprise apps, it makes a difference.

## Conclusion

So? What we can say at the end of this massive story? Interface fits the core TypeScript philosophy better. :-p We may use `type` wherever it is needed, but we should prefer `interface` for defining object shapes. Though, both have their use cases, both looks similar and it's essential to choose the right one for our specific needs. This is always a good practice to follow what documentation says in TypeScript development.

# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

While using JavaScript, the pain in the neck for every developer is the lack of type safety. Though, personally javascript is my most favorite programming language. But, as a developer, I have to admit what is true. Javascript, because of its dynamic nature, is prone to runtime errors. On the other hand, it has no type defining architecture which causes a lot of confusion and bugs in the code. This is where TypeScript comes into play. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This means that we can define types for our variables, functions, and objects, which helps us catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Which means typescript is a complete package of type safety but with our old favorite flavour of coding in JavaScript. Let's see how TypeScript helps in improving code quality and project maintainability.

## 1. Type Safety reduces bugs initially

TypeScript adds a layer of type checking over plain JavaScript. It knows what type of value should go where. It checks whether we are using a string where a number was expected. It warns us before running the code. This simple mechanism prevents many small bugs early in development. By defining types for our variables, functions, and objects, we can catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This helps us avoid common pitfalls and reduces the likelihood of bugs in our code. For example, if we try to assign a string to a variable that is supposed to be a number, TypeScript will throw an error at compile time, preventing us from running the code with a bug. This is a simple example, but it can save us a lot of time and effort in debugging later on.

## 2. Autocomplete and IntelliSense make development faster

TypeScript provides powerful autocompletion and IntelliSense features in modern IDEs. This means that as we type, TypeScript can suggest possible completions for our code based on the types we have defined. This helps us write code faster and with fewer errors. For example, if we define a function that takes a parameter of type `string`, TypeScript will suggest string methods when we call that function. This is a huge productivity boost, especially in large codebases where we may not remember all the available methods and properties for a given type. On the other hand, for declaring types, if we don't explicitly define the type of a variable, TypeScript will infer the type based on the value we assign to it. This means that we can still take advantage of TypeScript's type checking without having to explicitly define types for every variable. This is a great feature for quickly prototyping code or when we are working with dynamic data.

## 3. Documentation lives in your code

Types act like live documentation. When we see a function signature, we know exactly what it expects and what it returns. We don‚Äôt have to guess. We don‚Äôt have to search for examples. The types tell the story clearly. This makes it easier for us to understand how to use a function or object without having to read through documentation or comments.

## 4. Large team? TypeScript scales with us

When working in a large team, TypeScript helps us maintain code quality and consistency. By enforcing type safety and providing clear interfaces, TypeScript makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's code. This is especially important in large projects with multiple developers, where consistency matters. TypeScript ensures that people follow the contracts, limitations and conventions. It enforces agreements across files and teams. Everyone writes code with the same understanding of data structures and types.

## Conclusion

TypeScript is not just about types. It‚Äôs about confidence. It‚Äôs about writing code that we can trust. It‚Äôs about catching bugs before they reach users. It‚Äôs about scaling teams and projects without chaos. It‚Äôs about turning code into a system that holds itself together.
